# Unreleased

## Broker Transport (new)

- Add outbound WebSocket broker transport for production-grade builds (web, desktop, mobile release).
- New `Dispatcher` handler registry with `Transport` abstraction (VM service + broker).
- `BrokerTransport` with JSON-RPC 2.0 codec, frame discriminator, auth handshake, idle timeout, and auto-reconnect.
- `BrokerServer` in marionette_mcp: local WS server with token auth, idle enforcement, and request relay.
- `BrokerDiscovery` via handle files in TMPDIR for auto-discovery.
- CLI: `marionette broker start/status/stop` commands.
- CLI: `--broker [<uri>]` flag on all action commands with auto-discovery.
- Screencast frames routed through broker transport (binary frames with 0x02 discriminator).
- Connected overlay widget (forced-on in release builds).
- Tree-shake: broker code excluded when `MARIONETTE_ENABLED` flag is absent.

## Other changes

- Surface `Semantics(label:)` and `Semantics(value:)` in `get_interactive_elements`. Widgets that render via inline-span trees (`Text.rich`, custom-painted text, etc.) where `toPlainText()` loses structure can now be made fully readable by agents through an explicit accessibility annotation, without altering the rendered widget.

# 0.5.0

- **Breaking:** Pass `Element` instead of `Widget` to the `extractText` configuration callback, giving access to the full element context. Migration: change `(widget)` to `(element)` and use `element.widget` to access the widget.
- Add gesture support across all layers: `swipe/drag`, `long_press`, `double_tap`, `pinch_zoom`, and `press_back_button`.
- Add video recording with TCP/WS transport and Android auto-fallback.
- Improve screencast stability with broken-pipe race handling, concurrent stop safety, and orphaned session cleanup.
- Improve runtime robustness around input validation, resource cleanup, and non-monotonic timestamp handling.
- Strengthen release CI with explicit minimum-version compatibility checks and Flutter version sourced from `.fvmrc`.
